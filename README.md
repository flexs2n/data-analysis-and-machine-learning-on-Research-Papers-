# data-analysis-and-machine-learning-on-Research-Papers-

perform data analysis and machine learning on a dataset. Some of the data entries correspond to data for real papers submitted to the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) in 2023 (one of the top venues for machine learning publications), and others are fake entries, generated by various Large language models (LLMs).

The columns of the dataset (attached as a CSV below) are as follows:

title: The title of the paper
abstract: The abstract of the paper
TLDR: A one-line summary of what the paper is about
generated: Whether the paper was generated by an LLM or not
model: The LLM used to generate the data ("human" if not generated)
pred: The predicted probability that the paper is fake given by the "Detectotron 5000" which received as input the paper's title, abstract, and TLDR.
